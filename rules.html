    <h1>RULES</h1>
    <div class="ruleset">
        <p>Objective: The goal is to move your frog across a busy road and a river to reach a safe zone at the top of the screen. Avoid obstacles and enemies along the way.</p>
        <p>Movement: Use the arrow keys (or designated controls) to move the frog:</p>
            <li>Up: Move the frog upward.</li>
            <li>Down: Move the frog downward.</li>
            <li>Left: Move the frog left.</li>
            <li>Right: Move the frog right.</li>
        <p>Obstacles:
            <li>Cars and Trucks: Move along the road, and you must avoid being hit by them.</li>
            <li>Water: When you reach the river, you need to use logs, turtles, and other floating objects to cross safely. If you fall into the water, you lose a life.</li>
        <p>Lives: You have a limited number of lives. Losing a life occurs when: </p>
            <li>You are hit by a car/truck.</li>
            <li>You fall into the water or fail to reach a floating object.</li>   
        <p>Safe Zones: At the top of the screen, there are "safe zones." The frog must reach these zones to complete a level. Each zone corresponds to a family of frogs.</p> 
        <p>Level Progression: As you complete levels, the game speeds up, and the difficulty increases with more cars, faster-moving objects, and more challenging obstacles.</p>
        <p>Winning: The game ends when you either lose all your lives or complete all the levels. The goal is to get as far as possible without losing all lives.</p>
